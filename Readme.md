## ANSIBLE PULL
Using Ansible "Pull" Mode to Dynamically Automate Server/Workstation Builds.
### What is that?

- It comes with ansible - if you already have it installed, you have `ansible-pull`.
- Allows Servers/workstations to `pull` ansible playbooks from a Git server, and run them locally.

- No need to maintain a server, `no single point of failure`.
- Leverages thefunctinality of Git to extend Ansible.
